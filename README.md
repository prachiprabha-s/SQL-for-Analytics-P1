Overview:

The SQL e-commerce project involves managing and analyzing data for customers, products, and transactions. The database consists of three main tables: Customers, Products, and Transactions. This project aims to provide insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product popularity through various SQL queries.

The analysis provides valuable insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance. 
Such data-driven decisions can help in strategizing marketing efforts, inventory management, and customer engagement initiatives to enhance overall business performance.
